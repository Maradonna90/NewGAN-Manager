# Installation Guide
I tried to make the whole installation process as much one-click and go as possible. Unfortunately providing a cross-platform app without managing a codebase for every supported platform is impossible to me. Therefore some small adjustments may be needed, depending on your system.

## Windows
1. Download the .msi Installer and go through the installtion process
2. Go to the NewGAN installation folder (e.g `%localappdata%\Programs\NewGAN Manager\`)
3. Move the `app\views\` folder to your Football Manager userfolder `My Documents\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 20XX\`

**Note**: The `AppData` folder is a hidden folder. How to make hidden folder visible on Windows 10 can be read [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028316/windows-view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-10)
## Linux
1. Download the .zip file and extract it.
2. give the AppImage executable rights with `sudo chmod +x *.AppImage`

## Mac
TBD

# Troubleshooting
If the app crashes for some reason open an issue and please provide the `newgan.log` file. It helps to figure where exactly the app crashed combined with your description.

## newgan.log on Windows
On Windows the log file is created in the installation directory. It should be under `%localappdata%\Programs\NewGAN Manager\`

## newgan.log on Linux
On Linux the log file is created wherever you place the `NewGAN_Manager-*.AppImage` file and execute it.

## newgan.log on Mac
TBD
